			Welcome to Qconsoled
		======================================

0.- LEEME file is more complete but in spanish :\

1.- What is Qconsoled?
	Qconsoled is a Quakeserver console server. And... what the hell is
this? Usually, when you put a quake server in a remote computer, like a
quakeworld server, you must put the quake server process into background
using nohup or similar, when you do it, there is no real access to the
server console, only connecting with a quakeworld client (usign admin codes
and things like that) or using rcon (aviable on quakeworld and quake2
servers only) that sends commands in UDP datagrams and return a result.

	Qconsoled pretends to be an alternative, doing the function of
connect like a telnet server, and bringing access to the console server.

2.- How to install it?	
	Edit defines.h file and modify it according to your server, be
carefully with absolute paths. Then type make, and it should compile
(if not... email me).
